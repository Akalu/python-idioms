# Preliminary steps

1) First check the version - it should be 3.9.x (3.9.1 in our case)

```
python --version

Python 3.9.1
```

2) Create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv env
```
As a result a folder env with python libs will be created

3) Activate virtual env:

```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
The promt will be changed to (env)

4) Install necessary dependencies into virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
As a result all extra dependencies will be added
